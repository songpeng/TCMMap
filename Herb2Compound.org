* Introduction
This project aims to provide a much detailed description of herbs from
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Especially:
1. To collect the compounds in the herbs including the metabolic products in the
   body.
2. To label the *Cold* and *Hot* characters of the herbs.
3. To label the *JUN*, *CHEN*, *ZUO*, and *SHI* characters of the herbs in the
   formula.
4. The usage of herbs on cancer treatment from TCM.
# 4. Analysis of targets of the compounds.
# 5. Analysis of GO or other functions of herbs (or formula)

This project can be treated as an extension of our previous database
_HerbBioMap_. We hope to spend one or two year to finish the first version.

* Results
** TODO collect the compounds [%]
- [ ] Establish the standard criteria.
- [ ] Design the standard records.
- [ ] Collect the compounds.
** TODO The usage of herbs on cancer treatment in China [%].
1. [ ] Collect the targets or mechanisms of the compounds from the herbs above.
   - [ ] Get the drugs from DrugBank with similar chemical structures.
   - [ ] Get the possible targets from ChEMBL or other database.
   - [ ] Literature mining
2. [ ] Analysis the functions of herbs.
   - [ ] Target-based analysis.\\
     In this part, we use the collected data above to analyze different
     compounds' functions independently. Note that some compounds may not
     directly target the tumor-related genes, such as "FU ZHENG" compounds.
   - [ ] Network-based analysis.\\
     In this part, we try to analyze the combination effects of different
     compounds based on the network analysis.
