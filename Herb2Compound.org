* Introduction
This project aims to provide a much detailed description of herbs from
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Especially:
1. To collect the compounds in the herbs including the metabolic products in the
   body.
2. To label the *Cold* and *Hot* characters of the herbs.
3. To label the *JUN*, *CHEN*, *ZUO*, and *SHI* characters of the herbs in the
   formula.
4. The usage of herbs on cancer treatment from TCM.
# 4. Analysis of targets of the compounds.
# 5. Analysis of GO or other functions of herbs (or formula)
